# Project Directory Structure

This folder has a directory structure similar to GBSR_2024. However, we have supplemented it with Data (including program code and analysis results from SIR).


# Example Explanation with \path\example.jpg

In this example, we analyze the code of Tacs8 and compare the results of traditional MBFL (Model-Based Fault Localization) techniques with those incorporating GBSR (Graph-Based Statistical Reasoning). We found a significant improvement in fault localization accuracy when using the combined approach. Additionally, by analyzing the TOP-N results across 23 programs from the selected SIR dataset, we observed that our method also shows substantial improvements in the SIR dataset.

## Example Analysis: Tacs8 Code

### Experimental Results

- **Tacs8 Analysis**:
  - In the Tacs8 code, traditional MBFL identified several potential faults with moderate accuracy.
  - When GBSR was incorporated, the accuracy of fault localization improved significantly, reducing the search space for developers.

- **SIR Dataset Analysis**:
  - We extended our analysis to 23 programs in the SIR dataset.
  - The TOP-N analysis, which measures the number of correct fault identifications within the top N ranked results, showed marked improvements with our method.
  - For instance, in TOP-1, TOP-3, and TOP-5 rankings, our approach consistently outperformed traditional MBFL.

### Key Findings

- **Improved Accuracy**: The combination of MBFL with GBSR resulted in more precise fault localization.
- **Reduced Debugging Time**: Developers can locate faults faster due to the higher accuracy and reduced search space.
- **Robust Performance**: Our method demonstrated significant improvements across multiple programs in the SIR dataset.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the example of Tacs8 and comparing traditional MBFL with the enhanced MBFL incorporating GBSR, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. The substantial improvements observed in both the specific example and the broader SIR dataset analysis indicate the potential of GBSR to significantly enhance fault localization techniques.
